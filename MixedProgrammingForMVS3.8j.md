 #Mixed Programming for MVS 3.8j

> The following documents my journey of learning mainframe  programming and administration on the MVS 3.8j operating system running on top of the Hercules emulator. 

I found early on the the very old COBOL compiler on MVS had severe limitations so I resorted to learning 370 MVS assembler to create routines that could be called from a OBOL main program. Also using the COBOL **call** statement allows for a more modern procedural abstraction than using PERFORM with COBOL sections.
